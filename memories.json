Tests that call fireEvent.click(button) without act() wrapper\n2. Tests that call fireEvent.submit(form) without act() wrapper\n3. Tests that expect state changes after form submission\n\nKey issues found:\n- Line 205: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 223: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 244: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 290: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 311: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 336: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 364: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 381: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 398: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 430: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n- Line 449: fireEvent.click(button) without act()\n\nSolution: Wrap all fireEvent.click(button) calls that trigger form submission in act() calls.",

All 33 tests now pass without act warnings\n\nTests that were fixed:\n- trims whitespace from content before submission\n- uses correct API endpoint with postId\n- shows loading state during submission\n- clears form after successful submission\n- shows success styling after successful submission\n- success message disappears after 3 seconds\n- shows error message when API call fails\n- shows error styling when API call fails\n- error message disappears after 5 seconds\n- logs error to console when API call fails\n- maintains form content when API call fails\n- form is keyboard accessible (fireEvent.submit)\n\nAll form submission tests now properly handle async state updates without React act warnings.",
